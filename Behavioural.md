A good engineer always thinks like a product manager âš¡

A good engineer creates differentiating business value by aligning the work with business priorities. It is easy to write code and design systems, what's difficult is to drive business outcomes.

When you get your next work item, show extreme ownership and understand how your work fits into the larger scheme of things. Some questions about your work that can help you get clarity could be

- is your work helping in acquiring user acquisition?
- is your work helping in making experience 10x better?
- is your work directly or indirectly affecting the revenue growth?
- is your work helping the company reduce its expenditure?

Always remember, the priority is always business > product > engineering. Without business we do not stand a chance, so always align yourself with the business and drive positive outcomes.
